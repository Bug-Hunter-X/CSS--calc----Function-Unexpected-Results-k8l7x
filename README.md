This repository demonstrates a common issue with the CSS `calc()` function. The `bug.css` file contains code that exhibits unexpected behavior due to unit mismatch or a lack of explicitly set parent dimensions. The `bugSolution.css` file provides corrected code and explanations for resolving the issue.  The problem typically manifests as inconsistent rendering across different browsers or unexpected element dimensions.
