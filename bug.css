The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but it can sometimes lead to unexpected results if not used correctly. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` might not work as expected in all browsers if the parent element's width is not explicitly defined.  Another example is trying to use `calc()` with units that don't mix (e.g., `calc(100px + 2em)` might be problematic).
